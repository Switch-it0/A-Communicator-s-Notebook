            <h1>Thoughts</h1>
            <p>Purposive Communication, at first glance, seemed familiar to my Senior High 
              School's minor subject experience with Oral Communication. Both courses delved 
              into the intricacies of effective communication and the various obstacles that 
              can hinder it. However, as the course progressed, my thoughts wavered. But 
              I realized that it offered a more comprehensive approach to communication, 
              encompassing not just spoken language but also written and visual forms.</p>
            <p>Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the challenges posed by the course. 
              The demands of crafting myself can't be self-deprecating when communicating 
              through the English language, delivering good conversation, and creating 
              engaging presentations were daunting. Yet, as I persevered, I began to 
              appreciate the value of these experiences. The skills I’ve acquired, such as 
              critical thinking and communication have not only enhanced my academic 
              performance but also prepared me for future endeavors.</p>
            <p>And I believe that Purposive Communication has been an invaluable asset to my 
              personal and professional development. It has equipped me with the tools to 
              communicate effectively, a skill that is essential in today’s globalized world.</p>

              <h1>Experiences</h1>
              <p>Since it was a new setting for me and my classmates and I weren't very close 
                at the time, I was really anxious. Furthermore, I was unsure of what to 
                anticipate from our topic teacher and was considering what I could do to avoid 
                disappointing her. Then, when we were roleplaying, one of my favorite 
                assignments was to record our role-play presentation that portrayed a scenario 
                of getting to the right place after getting lost. In addition to being a lot of 
                fun, filming it brought myself and my group members great joy. Our relationship 
                grew closer as a result, and our activity was full of enjoyable moments and 
                laughs.</p>

                <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                <p>As weeks and months went by, lessons learned are learning about proper grammar, 
                  intonation when speaking, correct construction of a sentence, and lastly, 
                  performing relevant and effective communication. This lesson is an advantage to me 
                  as a student because we can use this to practice effective communication by 
                  applying the skills we have and doing it repeatedly.</p>

          <h1>Building Block of Effective Communication</h1>
          <h3>Learned during Class</h3>
          <img src="images/building-blocks.png">
          <p>From listening closely to Purposive Communication, I learned numerous lessons 
            and skills. But one thing I haven't forgotten since the beginning of class is 
            greetings and introductions, as well as more advanced topics like telling the 
            time, expressing opinions, and making requests.  </p>
          <p>Purposive Communication initially discusses communication and linguistic 
            hurdles, but I soon discovered that there is more to it, such as telling time.</p>
          <p>The first thing I've learned about <span>greetings</span> is that there are two types: 
            <span>informal and formal.</span> This is surprising as there are numerous methods to meet 
            people and how we learn to introduce ourselves, yet there is a proper way to do it.  </p>
          <h4>Formal</h4>
          <p>• Using a <span>full name</span> in formal or business situations. </p>
          <p>• Using <span>titles when referring to yourself</span> is not in common but it is polite to use 
            titles with others, especially in formal situations </p>
          <p>• Use common phrases that it is polite to use such as <span>Good morning and Hello, 
            it's nice to see you</span></p>
          <h4>Informal</h4>
          <p>• Using a <span>first name</span> in casual talk  </p>
          <p>• Use common phrases that it short but it is a little polite such as <span>Hey and What's up.</span></p>

          <p>Second, <span>telling time accurately</span> is important for preventing misunderstandings 
            and promoting clear communication. To communicate clearly and in a casual manner, 
            we are taught to tell the time, but we are mistaken. </p>
          <h5>Examples:</h5>
          <p><span>• It's ten past three</span></p>
          <p><span>• it's a quarter to ten</span></p>
          <p><span>• it's half past four</span></p>

          <p>Another thing that I learned is how we <span>express</span> something. For me, it is a surprise that 
            there's a correct way to do it but it is purposive communication.</p>
          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>When using <span>negative (no, not)</span>, only use one at a time in any idea or expressing 
            something, because you will create a <span>double negative,</span> which is an error.</p>

          <p>Another unforgettable thing that I learned is how to use the <span>Modal Verbs.</span></p>
          <h5>Modal Verbs</h5>
          <p><span>• Can / Could</span></p>
          <p><span>• Should</span></p>
          <p><span>• Would</span></p>

          <p>Modal verbs like <span>can, could, should, and would</span> are essential for effective 
            communication as they convey different meanings and intentions. The verb <span>"can"</span> is 
            commonly used to express ability, permission, or possibility. For example, you might 
            say, "I <span>can</span> complete the project by tomorrow," to indicate capability. Also the verb 
            <span>"could"</span> is used like the verb <span>"can"</span> but it is more polite than the verb <span>"can".</span>
            For example, "<span>Could</span> we please go on a trip this weekend?".</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, <span>"should"</span> is used to offer advice, express obligation, or reflect on something that might be expected. For instance, 
            "You <span>should</span> study for the exam" suggests a recommendation or duty</p>
          <p>On the other hand, <span>"would"</span> is versatile, often employed for politeness, 
            hypothetical situations, or preferences. For example, "I <span>would</span> help you if I had 
            more time" reflects a conditional statement, while "Would you like some coffee?" shows 
            politeness in making an offer. Mastering these modal verbs enhances clarity and adds 
            nuance to spoken and written communication.</p>

          <p>Using these <span>modal verbs</span>appropriately ensures your communication is clear, respectful, 
            and expressive.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, this subject reminded me of the right use of <span>four crucial proper punctuation marks.</span></p>
          <h4>Period (.)</h4>
          <p>The <span>purpose</span> is to mark the end of a declarative phrase or indirect question.</p>
          <h4>Comma (,)</h4>
          <p>The <span>purpose</span> is to indicate a pause, break down elements, or clarify meaning.</p>
          <h4>Apostrophe (')</h4>
          <p>The <span>purpose</span> demonstrates possession or forms contractions.</p>
          <h4>Quotation Mark ("")</h4>
          <p>The <span>purpose</span> is to include direct speech, titles, or quotes.</p>

              <h1>Building a Strong Foundation in English</h1>
              <h3>Learned during Class</h3>
              <img src="images/bridge.png">
              <p>Listening intently to Purposive Communication taught me many valuable 
                lessons and skills. But there is something I haven't forgotten since we 
                started midterms. I've learned the Yes/No Question and WH Question</p>
              <p>After the preliminary of Purposive Communication, I am eager to study 
                more because English is more sophisticated than you realize.   </p>
              <p>The first is the <span>Yes or No Question</span>. In that lesson, I learned how to turn 
                a statement into a Yes or No question. It is not easy to convert since the 
                converting procedure involves numerous steps, or it must be considered before 
                conversion. Like these examples: </p>
              <p>• If the statement has <span>only one verb</span> and the verb is a form of <span>"be",</span> simply 
                <span>switch the locations of the subject and verb</span>. EXAMPLE: <span>Matthew is</span> a chef - <span>Is Matthew</span> a chef?</p>
              <p>• If there are <span>two verbs</span>, <span>simply reverse the locations of the subject and the first verb. </span>
                EXAMPLE: <span>Maria is</span> driving a family car - <span>Is Maria</span> driving a family car? </p>
              <p>• If there is one verb and the verb is not a form of <span>"be,"</span> the process is more complex: Add 
                <span>"do"</span> to the beginning of the sentence. The Levins live in that Apartment -  <span>Do</span> the Levins 
                live in that Apartment?</p>
              <p>• If the main verb has a <span>third-person singular -s</span>, transfer it to <span>"do,"</span> resulting in 
                <span>"does"</span>. For example, Lyca <span>drives</span> an automobile. <span>Does</span> Lyca drive a car?</p>
              <p>• If the main verb is in the <span>past tense</span>, change it to <span>"do"</span> to make it <span>"did."</span> Example: 
                Ken <span>played</span> basketball last week. <span>Did</span> Ken play basketball last week? </p>
    
              <p>I also recall the <span>"be verbs"</span> from that lesson, which are used to indicate 
                the subject's status. Example: </p>
              <p><span>• Present tense am, are, is;</span> </p>
              <p><span>• Past tense was, were;</span> </p>
              <p><span>• Past participle been;</span> and</p>
              <p><span>•  Present participle being;</span> </p>

              <p>The second tip is the <span>WH Question</span>. In that lesson, I learned how to turn a 
                statement into a WH Question. If the Yes or No Question is a simple question, this 
                type of question is not difficult, but you learned about it. Also, before converting 
                this WH Question, analyze the converting method. Consider the following examples:  </p>
              <p>• To make a question using the predicate pattern, first form a yes- or no- question by 
                inverting the subject and first auxiliary verb, then add the appropriate 
                wh-word to the beginning of the sentence: <span>The meeting was some time - When was the meeting?</span> </p>
              <p>• If there is no auxiliary (verb) and the verb is not <span>"be", add "do"</span> to the beginning 
                of the sentence, then add the appropriate wh-question word. Be sure to <span>transfer the 
                tense and number</span> from the main verb to the word "do".</p>
              <h5>Example:</h5>
              <p>• You want something. - What <span>do</span> you want?</p>
              <p>• You went somewhere. <span>(past tense)</span> -  Where <span>did</span> you go?</p>
              <p>• She likes something. <span>(3rd person, s)</span> - What <span>does</span> she like?</p>
    
              <p>Not only that, but there are  <span> subject patterns, predicate 
                patterns, and the auxiliary verb</span>, sometimes known as the helping verb:</p>
              <h5>Subject Pattern</h5>
              <p>Simply change the <span>person or item being asked</span> about with the <span>proper wh-word</span>. 
                 Example is <span>Something</span> is bothering you. - <span>What</span> bothers you?</p>
              <h5>Predicate Pattern</h5>
              <p>The <span>formulation of wh-questions</span>  is determined by the presence of an <span>auxiliary (helping) 
                verb</span>  in the original sentence:<span>I should have</span> finished my homework- <span>Who</span> finished 
                <span>his/her</span> homework?</p>
              <h5>Auxiliary Verb</h5>

              <h1>Building Advanced English Languange Skills</h1>
              <h2>Learned during Class</h2>
              <img src="images/ascending.png">
              <p>Listening carefully to Purposive Communication taught me many essential 
                lessons and skill sets. But there is one thing I haven't forgotten since we 
                started pre-finals. I've studied the <span>Preposition of Place, Transitional Words,
                 and Comparative and Superlative Adjectives.</span></p>
              <p>Following the midterm for Purposive Communication, I am ready to learn more 
                because English is more advanced than you know.   </p>
              <p>The first is the <span> Preposition of the Place</span>, which is similar to a locator or,
                 in today's world, Waze and Google Maps. I only put it that way because it guides us 
                 through the domain of nouns. Others are familiar with them, although others are unsure 
                 how to use the words <span>in, on, and at</span> properly.</p>

              <p>In: Use <span>it</span> to talk about a place that is inside a <span>bigger space</span>, 
                such as <span>a box, a house, a city, or a country.</span> Also, use it with 
                other<span>physical locations.</span></p>
                <h5>Example</h5>
              <p>• My dog is <span>in</span> the box.</p>
              <p>• <span>in</span> the mountains / the countryside / a valley / the forest</p>

              <p>On: Use <span>on</span> to talk about <span>location on a surface</span> and 
                for some types of <span>public transport that we can have a movement</span>. 
                Also, used for <span>lines (including rivers, borders, streets, 
                etc.) and islands.</span></p>
              <h5>Example</h5>
              <p>• There's a market for computers <span>on</span>Quezon Ave.</p>
              <p>• The plant is <span>on</span> the desk.</p>
              <p>• You can't make phone calls <span>on</span> a plane.</p>

              <p>At: Use <span>at</span> in many common phrases, especially when we are 
                <span>talking about a place for a specific activity,</span> and use <span>at</span>
                for <span>addresses or exact positions.</span></p>
              <h5>Example</h5>
              <p>• I'm working on my blog site <span>at</span> home today.</p>
              <p>• He's waiting <span>at</span> the entrance.</p>
    
              <p>The second point to consider is that <span> transitional words </span>are often overlooked 
                in sentences. They may not be an obvious element of the writing process, but 
                they are critical for producing well-structured and compelling work. They 
                function like bridges, seamlessly transporting your thoughts from one location 
                to another. According to what I learned, these are typical transitional words:</p>
              
              <h5>To indicate cause/effect or reason:</h5>
              <p>• Because</p>
              <p>• Since</p>
              <p>• Due to</p>
              <h5>To indicate an example:</h5>
              <p>• For example</p>
              <p>• For instance</p>
              <h5>To indicate comparison/contrast</h5>
              <p>• But</p>
              <p>• Although</p>
              <p>• In comparison...</p>
              <p>• In contrast...</p>
              <h5>To indicate time or sequence:</h5>
              <p>• At First</p>
              <p>• Meanwhile</p>
              <p>• Lastly/Finally</p>
    
              <p>Lastly, <span> Comparative and Superlative Adjectives</span> are words that describe, 
                identify, or quantify nouns and pronouns. They help specify our writing by offering 
                more details about nouns and pronouns. But there are differences between the two:</p>

              <h3>Comparative Adjective:</h3>
              <p>• Used to <span> compare two things </span>they describe differences between two nouns.</p>
              <p>• The suffix <span>-er</span> will be added for comparative adjectives.</p>
              <p>• In some cases, the sentence will end after the comparative adjective and not include 
                the object of comparison. This structure is possible when the context has provided 
                enough information to make the comparison clear. </p>
              <h5>Examples:</h5>
              <p>• My television is <span>bigger</span>  than my computer.</p>
              <p>• My brother is 6 feet tall, but my father is  <span>taller. </span></p>

              <h3>Superlative Adjective:</h3>
              <p>• Used to <span>compare three or more things</span>. They help describe things on either end of a 
                spectrum</p>
              <p>• The suffix <span> -est </span>for superlative adjectives.</p>
              <p>• The object of comparison, like comparative adjectives, might be absent sometimes. </p>
              <h5>Examples:</h5>
              <p>• My English professor is the <span>smartest</span>  person.</p>
              <p>• We took an exam in class today, and I scored the <span> highest.</span></p>
    
              <p>They are not easy to create a comparative and superlative but there are keywords the 
                <span>"than"</span> for comparative and <span>"the"</span> for superlative
                but there are also in creating this adjective they are not always suffixes 
                of <span>-er</span> and <span>-est</span>. The following are the tips:</p>

              <h4>One syllable adjective:</h4>
              <p>• When the adjective has a single vowel between two consonants 
                <span>(consonant + single vowel + consonant)</span>, the second consonant will be 
                doubled. For example, Adjective = hot - h (consonant) + o (single vowel) + 
                t (second consonant) = <span> Comparative form: hotter and Superlative form: hottest.</span></p>
              <h4>Two-Syllable Adjectives</h4>
              <p>• For comparative adjectives, the suffix <span>-er</span> will be added or preceded 
                by <span>more</span>. Superlative adjectives will be preceded by <span>most</span> or the suffix 
                <span>-est</span>.  When in doubt, use <span>more or most</span> rather than a suffix. 
                For adjectives ending in <span>y</span>, the <span>y</span> will be replaced with an i, and the appropriate suffix will be added.</p>
              <h4>Three-Syllable Adjective:</h4>
              <p>Comparative adjectives will be preceded by <span>nore</span>, and superlative adjectives 
                will be preceded by <span>most</span>. </p>

              <h3>An irregular adjective</h3>
              <p>• Are irregular if their comparative and superlative forms do not follow the standards 
                outlined.</p>
              <h5>Tips & Examples:</h5>
              <p>• good, better, best.</p>
              <p>• much, more, most.</p>    
              <p>• Avoid using <span>"nore"</span> with a comparative created with <span>"-er"</span> 
                or <span>"most"</span> with a superlative produced with <span>"-est</span>.</p>    
              <p>• Stress that the <span> "as [adjective] as" </span>formulation is intended 
                to express equality through comparison. For example, <span>"as cute as" </span> 
                does not mean <span> "cuter as."</span></p>
